# Small Business Network Design Proposal (Wired Ethernet)

## Overview
This repository contains a complete **network infrastructure design proposal** for a small business relocating to a new office. The project focuses on creating a **secure, reliable, and scalable wired network** using switch-based Ethernet and a star topology.

The proposal includes business requirements analysis, logical network design, hardware and software selection, cybersecurity considerations, and a full cost assessment.

## Project Objectives
- Design a wired Ethernet network suitable for multiple simultaneous users  
- Ensure fast speeds, reliability, and ease of management  
- Minimize cybersecurity risks through proper hardware and software choices  
- Provide a cost-effective solution with clear short-term and long-term costs  

---

## Network Design Summary
- **Network Type:** Switch-based Ethernet  
- **Topology:** Star topology  
- **Connectivity:** Wired LAN with WAN internet access  
- **Users Supported:** 5 employee workstations and 1 networked printer  
- **Internet Provider:** Business-grade broadband

## Logical Network Design
The logical design uses a **star topology**, with all devices connected to a central switch. The switch connects to a router, which then connects to the Internet via the ISP. This design improves performance, simplifies troubleshooting, and allows devices to communicate simultaneously.
